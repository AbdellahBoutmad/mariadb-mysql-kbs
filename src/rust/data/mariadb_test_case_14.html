<h4 class="anchored_heading" id="gtid_pos_auto_engines"><code>gtid_pos_auto_engines</code></h4>
<p>This variable is used to enable multiple versions of the <a
        href="/kb/en/mysqlgtid_slave_pos-table/">mysql.gtid_slave_pos</a> table, one for each transactional storage
    engine in use. This can improve replication performance if a server is using multiple different storage engines in
    different transactions.</p>
<p>The value is a list of engine names, separated by commas (','). Replication
    of transactions using these engines will automatically create new versions
    of the mysql.gtid_slave_pos table in the same engine and use that for future
    transactions (table creation takes place in a background thread). This avoids introducing a cross-engine transaction
    to update the GTID position. Only transactional storage engines are supported for
    gtid_pos_auto_engines (this currently means <a href="/kb/en/innodb/">InnoDB</a>, <a
        href="/kb/en/tokudb/">TokuDB</a>, or <a href="/kb/en/myrocks/">MyRocks</a>).</p>
<p>The variable can be changed dynamically, but replica SQL threads should be stopped when changing it, and it will take
    effect when the replicas are running again.</p>
<p>When setting the variable on the command line or in a configuration file, it is
    possible to specify engines that are not enabled in the server. The server will then still start if, for example,
    that engine is no longer used. Attempting to set a non-enabled engine dynamically in a running server (with SET
    GLOBAL gtid_pos_auto_engines) will still result in an error.</p>
<p>Removing a storage engine from the variable will have no effect once the new tables have been created - as long as
    these tables are detected, they will be used.</p>
